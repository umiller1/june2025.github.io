                <h2>One Pot Pumpkin Mac & Chez</h2>
                <p>
                    Pumpkin season calls for hearty, comforting 
                    recipes, and this one-pot mac and cheese is 
                    exactly that. Don’t worry, it doesn’t taste like a 
                    pumpkin spice latte. The pumpkin adds a natural 
                    sweetness, just like tomatoes or carrots would in 
                    a sauce. The result is a rich, velvety mac and 
                    cheese with a subtle fall twist that feels both 
                    warming and familiar.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a large pot over medium heat, melt the 
                        butter. Add the garlic, sage, and thyme and 
                        cook until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                        Remove the sage leaves and thyme sprigs and 
                        discard them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Still over medium heat, pour in the chicken 
                        broth and stir in the pumpkin purée and heavy 
                        cream until smooth. Season with mustard powder
                        , onion powder, cayenne, smoked paprika, salt, 
                        and nutmeg.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raise the heat to medium-high, add the pasta, 
                        and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a 
                        simmer and cook uncovered, stirring 
                        frequently, until the pasta is tender and most 
                        of the liquid has been absorbed, about 14 to 
                        15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower the heat to the lowest setting, add the 
                        cheeses, and gently fold them in with a rubber 
                        spatula until completely melted into the 
                        sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve hot, garnished with parmesan and freshly 
                        cracked black pepper.

                <h2>Matchert Milkt Jamt</h2>
                <p>
                    This matcha milk jam is thick, creamy, and packed 
                    with deep matcha flavor in every spoonful. It 
                    slowly cooks down until rich and jammy, then gets 
                    whisked with vibrant matcha for the perfect earthy 
                    finish. Spread it on toast, drizzle it over 
                    pancakes, or just eat it straight from the jar.
                </p>
                <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup milk powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon matcha powder</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons room temp water</li>

                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, 
                        cream, sugar, cornstarch, milk powder, and 
                        vanilla extract until smooth and fully 
                        dissolved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place the pan over medium-low heat and cook, 
                        stirring often, until it begins to gently 
                        bubble.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continue cooking on low to medium-low heat for 
                        45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring frequently to 
                        prevent sticking. The mixture should reduce 
                        and thicken to a creamy, jammy consistency 
                        that coats the back of a spoon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While it’s cooking, whisk the matcha powder 
                        with the water in a small bowl using a W and 
                        M motion until completely smooth and 
                        lump-free.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the milk jam has thickened, remove the 
                        pan from heat. Add the matcha mixture and 
                        whisk until fully combined and smooth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the matcha milk jam into a clean jar and 
                        let it cool to room temperature. It will 
                        thicken slightly as it cools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Store in the refrigerator for up to one week. 
                        It continues to firm up the longer it sits in 
                        the fridge, so give it a stir before using if 
                        needed!

                <h2>Pão de Deus</h2>
                <p>
                    Pão de Deus translates to "Bread of God," and 
                    after one bite, you’ll understand why. I had it in 
                    Portugal and it was heavenly—sweet, soft, and 
                    topped with the most luscious coconut crust. 
                    Honestly... dare I say, it might be even better 
                    than a pastel de nata.
                </p>
